ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, techies!

Are you planning to get into Open Source World?
Then you are at a good place, this is a simple web app to help new Developers to improve using the best practices being followed in the Tech World.

So, let's get going.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the repository:
Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page on GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

### 2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-site.git
```
> Replace your-username with your GitHub username.

### 3. Create a branch
Make a meaningful name for your new branch.

Some Best Practices while naming branches:
+ hotfix -	for quickly fixing critical issues, usually with a temporary solution
+ fix -	for fixing a bug
+ feature - for adding, removing, or modifying a feature
+ test - for experimenting with something that is not an issue

This word is followed by your task.

Suppose you want to add a favicon to the website so you can name the branch as feature/add-favicon.

Now Once you have decided on the name of your branch. 

Then create and switch to it using this command:

```
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

After making your changes, you need to stage the changes for commit using the git add command. To stage all changes, use:
```
git add .
```

Or you can select only certain files with changes from VS Code Source Control Button.

Commit your staged changes with a descriptive commit message that explains the purpose of your changes. Use the git commit command:
```
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"
```

Push Your Changes:
```
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Now submit the Pull Request.

> If there are no issues, you can create any issue or feature you want to have and then raise the Pull Request.
